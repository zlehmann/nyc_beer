# NycBeer

Welcome to the NYC Beer Gem! This gem was developed, as a Flatiron School project, to help users explore the breweries of New York City through a command line interface. This gem allows the user to view a list of every brewery in New York City and pull up beer lists for each brewery.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nyc_beer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nyc_beer

## Usage

Execute the bin file './bin/nyc_beer'. You will be prompted with a list of the breweries in New York City. You can enter the corresponding number for any brewery to pull up that brewery's beer list containing details about each beer.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
